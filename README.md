## 🧑🏽‍💻 About Me  
Hey, I'm **Visshal Natarajan**—an MA Associate @ SGX. That's my job, but I am super keen on experimenting new tech. I am tinkering with MCP, AI agents and I love networks. I also think a song can reveal loads about someone. So here's a part of me, my favourite song. 

Why is my username Dr-lazarus? Honestly it sounds really cool, I was quite surprised no one took it already.
